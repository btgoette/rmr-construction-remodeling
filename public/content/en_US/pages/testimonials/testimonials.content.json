I valued his opinion and gave them a call. I had not experienced any roof leaks as of yet, but watching my other neighbors and the problems with  their roof leaks and patchy roof repairs left me wondering what's the best strategy for a almost 30 year roof. I opted for a complete roof replacement. I was given a cost estimate and the possibility of damaged wood replacement, but that couldn't be determined until the roof was completely removed. Luckily I had very little damage, mostly just some trim, due to sun exposure. Top quality material was used and I even had my gutters with leaf guards installed. They did it all in a week. The workers were respectful and tidy. These guys worked really hard and my wife and I are very happy ðŸ˜Š."

After explaining to me (very clearly) how the roof is designed, he assured me there was no real cause for concern. Though it may not have been the best design or construction practices (28 year old roof), there was no reason to be worried, other than the minor aesthetics.

I called Sunday and left a message for RMR Construction & Remodeling and was amazed that the owner, Jeff, called me back Monday morning and had his crew out before end of day. Not only did they fix the issue on the spot, Jeff went out of his way to explain everything and reassure me. I cannot applaud this company enough. They deserve 10 stars in an era where it is so rare to find companies with such integrity and customer oriented. Thank you Jeff and your crew!! I'll keep you on my speed dial for any future roofing issues!"

I called RMR Construction & Remodeling and Jeff ( the owner) came out the same day. He took photos, did a temporary patch & seal initially and returned the following day with material to seal the roof enough to get us through the next series of storms. Once the weather cleared he replaced all the damage ( caused by squirrels) to the roof, installed an underlayment that was superior to the original one and made all the repairs necessary to get us a water proof roof structure again. They also installed wire mesh to prevent the squirrels from getting back to their spot under our Spanish tile roof. They were quick, clean and very respectful of our property. The repair work turned out great and we are ready for the next round of storms. RMR Construction & Remodeling is now my permanent go to roofing company."

It's hard to find a reliable and honest contractor it seems these days, but I would trust Jeff with any future work and cannot recommend him highly enough.
