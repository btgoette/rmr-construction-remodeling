I wanted to extend my backyard concrete patio area, extend my front driveway and add a RV parking concrete driveway. I got quotes from many companies. However, I chose RMR because they had the best price while at the same time still offering the same quality build materials and build standards as all the other more expensive companies. RMR was very responsive throughout the construction process, I would receive responses to my questions in a timely fashion. RMR provided me with a timeline to the construction process which they stuck too and completed the project on time as promised. It was a great experience working with RMR."
