I had no leaks and the sag was not visible from inside the attic. Jeff Vogt came by and did a thorough inspection of the area. After explaining to me (very clearly) how the roof is designed, he assured me there was no real cause for concern. Though it may not have been the best design or construction practices (28 year old roof), there was no reason to be worried, other than the minor aesthetics. He could have pursued a big payday but instead, satisfied my concerns and saved me $$$. I highly recommend RMR Construction & Remodeling for their expertise and professional manner."

I called Sunday and left a message for RMR Construction & Remodeling and was amazed that the owner, Jeff, called me back Monday morning and had his crew out before end of day. Not only did they fix the issue on the spot, Jeff went out of his way to explain everything and reassure me. I cannot applaud this company enough. They deserve 10 stars in an era where it is so rare to find companies with such integrity and customer oriented. Thank you Jeff and your crew!! I'll keep you on my speed dial for any future roofing issues!"

I called RMR Construction & Remodeling and Jeff ( the owner) came out the same day. He took photos, did a temporary patch & seal initially and returned the following day with material to seal the roof enough to get us through the next series of storms. Once the weather cleared he replaced all the damage ( caused by squirrels) to the roof, installed an underlayment that was superior to the original one and made all the repairs necessary to get us a water proof roof structure again. They also installed wire mesh to prevent the squirrels from getting back to their spot under our Spanish tile roof. They were quick, clean and very respectful of our property. The repair work turned out great and we are ready for the next round of storms. RMR Construction & Remodeling is now my permanent go to roofing company."

We had some unexpected dry rot and Jeff offered solutions keeping in mind any future resale considerations at a fair price. It's hard to find a reliable and honest contractor it seems these days, but I would trust Jeff with any future work and cannot recommend him highly enough. As a bonus, he was very responsive with questions and took the time to explain the process or any decisions that needed to be made. If you need a roof done right, reach out to Jeff and RMR Construction & Remodeling--you won't be disappointed."
